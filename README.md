# Multicluster Algorithm Pointers

*Multicluster algorithm to calculate clusters in a lattice using pointers*

**This is my** ~~Currently~~ **Post doctorade research project**

The work is done by using different actions:
- Standard Action
  - beta
- Delta constraint

The code was written in
- [x] FORTRAN
- [x] C++
